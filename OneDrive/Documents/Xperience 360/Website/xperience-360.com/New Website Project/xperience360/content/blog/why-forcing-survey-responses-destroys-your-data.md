I received a survey from the BBC today. Probably like millions of other people.

Like everyone else, I don't respond to every survey in my inbox, but I actually wanted to participate in this one.

The survey was long, so (again, like everyone else) I instinctively allocated a reasonable amount of time to complete it by answering the questions where I had a clear opinion, and skipping those where I didn't.

To my surprise, I wasn't allowed to submit it like that.


❌ *All the questions were mandatory.*

❌ *No skipping allowed.*


In other words, I was **forced** to have an opinion about everything the BBC asked.

This is a very common mistake companies make when designing surveys: they assume that customers are as invested in the questionnaire as the team that designed it. Spoiler alert: they're not.

*Respondents can't submit their honest answers.*

If you *force* people to answer every question, even when they don't have a real opinion, you are *forcing* them to give random answers.


❌ Random responses contaminate your data.
❌ Contaminated data will ruin your analysis.
❌ The whole project ends up (or should end up) in the bin, along with the budget you spent on it.


Instead:


✅ *Make sure you don't force respondents. You can't force real feedback.*

✅ *Prioritise the quality of responses, not the quantity.*

✅ *Only make a question mandatory if it's critical to the logic of the survey.*


It's a hard lesson that many companies, including, sadly, today, the BBC, still haven't learned.
