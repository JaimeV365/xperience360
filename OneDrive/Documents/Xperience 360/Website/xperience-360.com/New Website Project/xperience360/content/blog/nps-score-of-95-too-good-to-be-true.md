I recently saw someone on LinkedIn celebrating an NPS score of 95. The comments were full of congratulations and admiration.

I wonder if they actually understand how NPS works, or if they just assume that others don't. Some people seem to treat NPS as a percentage that needs to be pushed towards 100 and then used for advertising purposes.

I understand that high scores make for powerful marketing. However, an NPS score of 95 is technically dubious and misleading to anyone who understands how NPS actually works, whether intentionally or not.

If you're wondering how companies can inflate their NPS scores artificially, I've written about the most common tactics in my <a href="https://xperience-360.com/blog/bad-boys-cx-ultimate-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 600;">Bad Boys of CX: The Ultimate Guide</a>. Cherry-picking respondents, timing surveys strategically and asking loaded questions are just a few of the tricks that might be at play.

An honest NPS will rarely, if ever, be 95. If yours is, you might not actually be measuring customer experience; you could be measuring how well you've gamed the system.
