excerpt: "An NPS of 95 sounds impressive, but it's technically dubious and often a sign of a gamed system rather than genuine customer loyalty. Learn why such 'perfect' scores should raise questions, not applause."

I recently saw someone on LinkedIn celebrating their NPS of 95. The comments were full of congratulations and admiration. I wonder if they actually understand how NPS works, or if they assume others won't. Some people seem to treat NPS like a percentage that needs to be pushed towards 100 for mere advertising purposes. High scores make for powerful marketing, I understand that. But an NPS of 95 is technically dubious and, intentional or not, misleading to anyone who understands how NPS actually works.

In the video above, I walk through how it's mathematically possible to achieve an NPS of 95, and why such 'perfection' might actually be damaging your Voice of Customer programme rather than improving it.

If you're wondering how companies can artificially inflate their NPS scores, I've written about the most common tactics in my <a href="https://xperience-360.com/blog/bad-boys-cx-ultimate-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: 600;">Bad Boys of CX: The Ultimate Guide</a>. Cherry-picking respondents, timing surveys strategically, and asking loaded questions are just a few of the tricks that might be at play. An honest NPS will rarely, if ever, be 95. If yours is, you might not be measuring customer experience—you could be measuring how well you've gamed the system.
