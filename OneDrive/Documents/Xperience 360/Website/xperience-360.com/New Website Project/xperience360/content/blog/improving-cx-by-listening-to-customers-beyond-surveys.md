In the world of customer experience (CX), one truth holds universally: knowing your customers is non-negotiable. Yet, a recent revelation from one of our clients suggests that even well-intentioned companies can miss the mark when it comes to truly understanding their customers' needs and pain points.

We've been collaborating with this client on a series of satisfaction surveys, aiming to gauge the pulse of their customer base. The results were, frankly, alarming. Only 7% of respondents reported being fully satisfied with their experience, while a staggering 93% indicated varying levels of dissatisfaction. Digging deeper, 96% of these dissatisfied customers cited delayed service delivery as a primary issue, and 92% pointed to communication failures—late responses, generic information, or no response at all—as a close second.

These numbers paint a clear picture, one that should have been visible to our client long before the survey results landed on their desk. The question we must ask is: why did it take a large-scale survey to uncover issues that nearly every customer seems to be facing?

Surveys are a valuable tool in any CX program, but they are not the only ones. The issues highlighted by our client's survey—timeliness and communication—are fundamental aspects of customer service that should have been on their radar without the need for a formal survey. This situation underscores a critical gap: a lack of ongoing, proactive customer listening.

It's crucial for companies to establish deeper listening processes that go beyond the traditional survey. [Complaints](/blog/the-critical-role-of-a-complaints-process-in-enhancing-customer-experience), for instance, should be viewed not just as isolated issues to be resolved, but as a goldmine of insights into broader systemic problems. Every complaint is a direct line to the voice of the customer, offering a cost-free opportunity to identify pain points before they escalate.

### **Listening Beyond the Survey: The Power of Proactive Engagement**

Moreover, frontline staff often have a wealth of knowledge about recurring customer frustrations. These employees interact with customers daily, hearing firsthand what surveys might only capture later. Tapping into this resource can provide real-time insights, enabling companies to address issues swiftly and avoid the damage that prolonged customer dissatisfaction can cause.

### **The Dangers of Survey Fatigue**

Another concern with over-reliance on surveys is the risk of survey fatigue. Customers today are inundated with requests for feedback from multiple sources, leading many to ignore these surveys altogether. If customers feel that their time is being wasted, or worse, that their feedback isn't leading to tangible improvements, they may opt out of future communications. This not only diminishes the effectiveness of surveys but also risks alienating customers.

### **The Cost of Inaction**

When companies wait for survey results to reveal widespread issues, they risk implementing solutions too late. By the time the data is analysed and action plans are developed, significant damage may have already been done. Customers who experience repeated delays and poor communication are likely to form a negative opinion of the brand. This dissatisfaction can quickly snowball, affecting not only customer retention but also the company's reputation and ability to attract new customers.

In today's competitive market, CX is directly tied to revenue. A company that fails to deliver on customer expectations in a timely and effective manner will see its bottom line suffer. Therefore, it's essential to recognise that customer service is not just a department—it's a critical component of the business strategy that has a direct impact on revenue.

### **Building a Holistic CX Program**

While surveys are an important aspect of CX, they should be just one part of a broader, more holistic strategy. Companies must develop robust systems for capturing and acting on customer feedback in real time. This includes leveraging complaints, tapping into the knowledge of frontline staff, and continuously monitoring key performance indicators that reflect the health of the customer experience.

In conclusion, our client was right to run surveys, but they should not stop there. To truly excel in customer experience, companies must **listen** more deeply and act more swiftly. By doing so, they can prevent issues from escalating, protect their brand reputation, and ultimately, drive long-term success.
