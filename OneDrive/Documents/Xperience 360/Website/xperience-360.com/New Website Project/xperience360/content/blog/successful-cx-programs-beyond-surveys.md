I had a meeting with a big global client the other day about how we keep improving the current CX programme in the future. They are very keen to run another wave of the usual customer satisfaction survey, which, of course, we can do for them. At the same time, we were actually encouraging them to go further and complement their surveys with other activities to maximise the impact of the entire CX programme.

### Why Do We Run Surveys in the First Place?

Here's the first question any business should ask itself: *Why* do you want to survey your customers? The obvious answer is that you want to gather their feedback and understand why they stay with you or why they leave you. You may have targets to meet that are tied to customer feedback, and you probably want to identify some quick wins and areas of improvement to act upon.

Of course, all of that is valid. But again, why? What do you want to do all of that for?

Well, **revenue**. That's the end goal, isn't it? You want to retain more customers, increase loyalty, drive repeat business, and strengthen your reputation. No argument there.

If we can agree on that, then we also need to accept that constantly bombarding customers with surveys is not necessarily the best strategy. Even if you can manage customer fatigue by not sending surveys too often to the same people, even if you take good care of the insights and carefully analyse them, and prepare action plans for improvements, there comes a point where you must close the loop. At some point, you need to get back to your customers and clearly tell them what you do with their feedback.

Revenue and reputation are critical business goals, but customers also need to feel there's something in it for them. They need to see that their voice matters.

### Customer Intimacy

During this meeting with this big global client, the concept of 'customer intimacy' has been mentioned a few times.

Whether you're B2B or B2C, surveys should be more than data collection; they're an opportunity to build a relationship, to show you're listening, to be transparent about your intentions.

Being honest and transparent will help to create a bond with the customer, even before being effective or reliable. Yes, if you are clear about your intentions with your surveys, why you send them, what you expect from them, or what you are planning to do with them, you are already making a commitment that the customer appreciates even on a personal and human level.

It's all about trust, about loyalty, it's about creating relations.

### Communicate – Listen – Act – Communicate Again

One of the most powerful messages a company can send to their customers after a survey is the classic you-said-we-did. Just a few bullet points explaining the main improvements and actions taken after analysing customers' insights will send a powerful message to customers, confirming that you are actually listening and you actually care about what they tell you.

Surveys without follow-up are not only pointless, they can be damaging. Even if you've made brilliant changes behind the scenes, if customers don't hear about them, it's as if nothing happened.

You can send a quick email update, you can design a dedicated space on your website, you can include a roundup in your newsletter, you can publish a report or a white paper, or even you can record a video or run a webinar or event to thoroughly explain the insights, the conclusions and the actions taken. Anything to make customers know that they are heard. You must make them feel that you care a great deal about what they say on those surveys.

### External *and* Internal Engagement

Clearly communicating your CX efforts to customers builds trust. But it does more than that—it increases the chances they'll *keep* responding to your surveys. If they can see that feedback leads to action, they'll be more willing to give it.

The same goes for your teams. CX communication shouldn't stop with customers. To really succeed, your programme needs *internal buy-in* too.

Your colleagues in Sales, Marketing, Customer Service, Product, Ops and other departments play a role in Customer Experience. They don't necessarily want to be told how to do their jobs, but they probably want tools that help them do their jobs better, more effectively and more appreciated. That's where your CX programme can really shine.

For example, imagine a Sales representative talking to a prospect and being able to say, as an additional selling point, something like: *"We have a dedicated CX team committed to actively listening to customer feedback and applying a continuous improvement approach to meet evolving needs."* That's not just a pitch, it's a game-changer differentiator.

The CX Programme is a shared goal, not someone else's side project. So other teams need to be involved in the common goal of retaining customers, securing revenue and ensuring a good reputation.

Internal momentum can be built in different ways, such as CX champions programmes, fun and relaxed training sessions, discussions and workshops. You can go as far as you want with both external and internal promotion of the CX Programme. I've seen companies that create a brand for the programme, with a logo, create posters, and send one-pagers.

The more teams involved, the merrier.

### Conclusion: Start and Finish by Communicating

In summary, you can run surveys, take actions, measure KPIs and meet your targets. But if you stop there, you may be missing a golden opportunity to stand out from your competitors and create a bond with your customers.

You have to let them know why you need their insights, and once you've acted on them, you need to *show* them what changed as a result.

At the same time, don't forget your colleagues. Internal engagement is essential if you want your CX programme to thrive. Share what you're doing, celebrate success, give teams valuable materials they can use, and provide opportunities to get involved. Everyone is to be part of the continuous improvement programme.

Great CX doesn't happen in isolation. It happens when everyone's on board, and customers know they're being heard.
