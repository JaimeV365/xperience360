In today's digital age, purchasing products online has become a seamless experience, or so it seems. Recently, I made an online purchase that started as a textbook example of excellent customer experience (CX). The website was easy to navigate, with all the necessary filters, transparent pricing, clear promotions, and a well-structured checkout process. Every step, from selecting products to completing payment, was flawless. After placing the order, I received a confirmation email that was both clear and informative, outlining the expected delivery timeline and refund policy—everything was perfectly in place.

### **The Delivery Breakdown**

However, this flawless experience took a nosedive when the delivery process began. The company had partnered with one of the major delivery firms, a name we've all heard of. This is where the trouble started.

Firstly, I received poorly structured emails from the delivery company, with unclear links that didn't lead to the promised information. The operational side was equally frustrating; I tried to provide details about where to leave the package in case I wasn't home, but the system failed to register my updates. Then, the final "out for delivery" message gave me a vague seven-hour window. While this isn't ideal for most customers, I was willing to accommodate since I work from home.

I waited patiently, only to receive a call from the delivery driver claiming he had attempted delivery three times and left my package at a collection point. This was a blatant lie. The driver, likely overwhelmed and looking to save time, chose to take shortcuts at the expense of my convenience.

### **Customer Experience and External Providers**

Understandably, I was livid. This experience has left a bitter taste, and I'll certainly avoid this delivery company in the future. But here's the crux of the issue: I never chose this delivery company. I made my purchase from an excellent retailer who, unfortunately, chose a subpar delivery service on my behalf.

The story doesn't end here. A few days later, I received a satisfaction survey from the retailer asking about my "overall experience." Given the disastrous delivery, I rated them poorly and explained that the final stage of the process had ruined an otherwise excellent experience.

### **The Feedback Loop and Business Responsibility**

To my surprise, the retailer contacted me to discuss my feedback. They explained that the delivery company was an external provider, and as such, they didn't feel it should impact my satisfaction rating.

This response missed the mark entirely.

When customers make a purchase, they're engaging with **your brand**—not your third-party providers. The delivery company, though external, is part of the overall customer journey. By choosing to work with a subpar provider, you're risking your reputation and the trust customers place in your brand.

### **Key Takeaways for Brands**

This experience highlights a crucial point for businesses: Be extremely vigilant when selecting and managing your external providers. Your CX processes must align with your standards, and that includes your partners. It's not just about the product or the initial stages of the customer journey; every touchpoint matters, especially the final ones. Regular audits, stringent performance evaluations, and open communication channels with your providers are essential to ensure they meet the high standards your customers expect.

In the end, your customers won't remember the name of the delivery company—they'll remember the frustration they felt when their package didn't arrive as expected. And unfortunately, that frustration will be associated with your brand, **not the provider's**.

Don't let an external provider ruin the experience you've worked so hard to create. Your reputation depends on it.
