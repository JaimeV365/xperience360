Customer service departments around the world handle customer interactions on a daily basis. Dealing with enquiries about delayed deliveries or technical issues has become their bread and butter, and they have found the Customer Effort Score (CES)<sup>1</sup> to be a metric that promises to cut through the clutter. Introduced in 2010, CES was designed to make problem-solving painless. The original CES question was straightforward: 'How much effort did you personally have to put forth to handle your request?', rated on a scale where low effort meant high loyalty potential. The outcome of the original research was clear: delighting customers with bells and whistles did not boost customer loyalty as much as simply reducing the effort required to resolve issues.

In those early days, CES focused on customer service touchpoints. Think call centres, support tickets and those seemingly endless phone menus that make you want to throw your device out of the window. Data from thousands of interactions showed that high-effort experiences were far more damaging to loyalty than low satisfaction alone. This was a wake-up call: improving resolution processes would boost retention without the need for excessive customer pampering.

The original paper is full of amazing discoveries, the most important of which is that, when it comes to customer loyalty, delighting customers is less efficient than simply making things easy for them. This is critical and revolutionary because companies invest a lot of effort in 'delighting' customers, going the extra mile, and so on. However, the key to retaining customers and fostering loyalty lies in eliminating friction, such as switching communication channels, being transferred, long waiting times, and having to explain the same thing twice.

But here's where things get even more interesting: CES didn't remain confined to its original purpose. As CX professionals began to apply it more broadly over the years, it evolved into a versatile tool for measuring ease throughout the entire journey. So now, effort isn't just about solving problems, but any interaction where customers expend energy. Nowadays, you'll see CES being used in website usability tests ("How easy was it to find what you needed?"), onboarding flows ("How straightforward was setting up your account?") and even in checkout processes ("How effortless was completing your purchase?"). This shift makes sense since digital experiences are full of potential friction points, from clunky navigation to confusing forms. This approach is fully aligned with McGovern's 'Top Tasks' principles<sup>2</sup>. Companies such as Qualtrics and SurveyMonkey now promote CES for these scenarios, supported by studies indicating that it is more effective than traditional satisfaction metrics at predicting abandonment rates in non-service contexts.

So, if CES has evolved from a service-specific metric to a journey-wide workhorse, how can we use it effectively without creating metric chaos? Should we use CES instead of CSAT? What about NPS® and the willingness to repurchase? There are a few good KPIs that can be used to reveal insights into the customer experience journey. Which one should we choose? Well, personalisation comes into play here, telling us that each company may require a different approach based on its own context and needs. Could a smarter, multi-KPI approach be used to match the right measure to the right moment of truth?

### **Matching Metrics to Moments: A Tailored KPI Strategy**

Let's face it: there is no single metric that rules them all. Treating your customer journey as if it were a one-size-fits-all survey is a recipe for shallow insights. Instead, think of your KPIs as a team of tag partners, each one stepping in at the optimal moment to capture the most important information. Here's how it works:

- **CSAT for transactional triumphs**: Use the Customer Satisfaction Score immediately after sales or initial interactions, such as post-purchase or during onboarding. It's ideal for gauging immediate satisfaction with a particular event, such as asking, "How satisfied were you with your checkout experience?" Use the results to identify areas for improvement: if scores decrease in relation to delivery speed, for example, adjust the logistics. Close the loop by sharing improvements via email updates and turning feedback into visible action to build trust. If we set up this approach correctly, we will be able to uncover some valuable quick wins.

- **CES for friction-fighting**: Focus on customer service resolutions and extend this to areas where effort is required, such as self-service portals or app troubleshooting. The key question becomes "How easy was it to resolve your issue?" Analyse the results to identify pain points, such as high effort in chat support. Train agents or simplify bots. Then take action: redesign processes, track reductions in repeat contacts and communicate changes to show customers that you are making their lives easier. This metric should refine processes and procedures, making them purely customer-centric, especially during <a href="/blog/building-emotional-bonds-with-customers-beyond-generic-advice-to-true-personalisation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moments of truth</a> that really matter<sup>3</sup>.

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS) for long-term loyalty checks**: Save the Net Promoter Score for relational milestones, such as after six months or a year of engagement, particularly during renewal or repurchase periods. 'How likely are you to recommend us?' is ideal here because it reflects cumulative experiences. Analyse verbatim comments from promoters and detractors to identify trends and add value. Use these insights to inform strategic shifts and follow up with 'you-said-we-did' reports to reinforce advocacy. NPS is a valuable tool for understanding the level of enthusiasm behind customers' opinions about the brand. This should help improve the brand's reputation.

The real magic happens when you follow through on each KPI's findings. Don't just collect data; segment it by customer type, correlate it with behaviours such as churn or spend, and prioritise actions. For example, if CES shows that support for high-value clients is highly effortful, reroute them to premium channels. Always communicate back; a simple newsletter stating, 'Based on your feedback, we've reduced resolution times by 20%' will keep the dialogue open and boost response rates for future surveys.

### **Multi-KPI Mastery vs. The One-Metric Wonder: Weighing the Wins and Woes**

Now, let's compare this multi-KPI playbook with the simpler approach of using one or two metrics throughout the entire customer journey. Is variety the spice of CX life, or does it just cause headaches?

**The Multi-KPI Approach: Pros and Cons**

On the plus side, it's like having a Swiss Army knife of insights. Tailoring metrics to specific situations provides a more accurate picture: CSAT identifies minor adjustments, CES detects underlying issues, and NPS highlights significant loyalty risks. This leads to better predictions: research from Forrester<sup>4</sup> shows that multi-metric strategies are more strongly correlated with revenue growth because they cover emotional, effort and behavioural angles. It also reduces survey fatigue by ensuring that questions are context-specific and actionable.

On the downside, complexity creeps in. Managing multiple KPIs requires more analysis time and can lead to integration issues with your CRM. There is also a risk of inconsistent benchmarks if teams disagree on thresholds. This can overwhelm smaller organisations without robust tools, leading to a paralysis of progress.

**The Consistent KPI Route: Simplicity's Sweet Spot**

Adopting a uniform approach, such as using NPS or CSAT consistently, keeps things streamlined. Advantages include easy comparisons across touchpoints, simpler dashboards and less confusion for stakeholders. This makes it ideal for benchmarking year on year without issues of comparing like with unlike, and Bain's NPS framework proves that it can drive enterprise-wide focus when used consistently.

However, the disadvantages are obvious: it misses nuances. Implementing NPS in a single chat disregards the role of effort in that moment, which could skew the data. You risk blind spots, such as overlooking friction that CES would pick up on, which can lead to misguided actions. In dynamic customer journeys, this one-dimensional approach often yields generic insights that fail to fully explain behaviours such as why satisfied customers still churn. Additionally, the 'one KPI for all' approach might leave us with an important question unanswered: what now? What should we do next?

Ultimately, the multi-KPI approach is best suited to mature CX programmes, offering the depth required for targeted improvements and stronger bonds. However, if your setup is lean, start consistently and build on it as you grow. The goal should be actionable intelligence that turns feedback into revenue, not just reports gathering dust.

### **Combining Metrics for Deeper Insights: The Role of Segmentor.app**

To further refine this multi-KPI approach, tools such as <a href="https://segmentor.app/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Segmentor.app</a> provide a practical method of combining metrics into numerical KPIs, enabling clear comparisons and the identification of genuine improvements. This customer segmentation tool enables you to use either CSAT or CES on the satisfaction axis and willingness to repurchase or NPS on the loyalty axis. This results in the four main segments originally introduced by Jones and Sasser's <a href="/blog/revisiting-the-apostles-model-understanding-customer-behaviour-in-todays-context" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apostles Model</a><sup>5</sup>: Loyalists (high satisfaction and loyalty), Mercenaries (high satisfaction and low loyalty), Hostages (low satisfaction and high loyalty) and Defectors (low satisfaction and low loyalty).

By mapping customers across these dimensions, Segmentor.app instantly visualises segments and provides action roadmaps prioritised by ROI for each segment. For example, it suggests ways to nurture loyal customers to encourage advocacy or fix pain points to prevent churn. Proximity analysis highlights at-risk customers near segment boundaries, while longitudinal tracking monitors changes over time to measure the impact of strategies. This introduces opportunities for gamification, such as setting conversion targets to turn Mercenaries into Loyalists, and turns static feedback into dynamic, predictive strategies that reveal blind spots and drive measurable growth.

So, what do you think? Are you ready to shake up your metrics, or are you sticking to the classics? Either way, remember that the most effective KPI is the one that actually improves your customers' lives.
