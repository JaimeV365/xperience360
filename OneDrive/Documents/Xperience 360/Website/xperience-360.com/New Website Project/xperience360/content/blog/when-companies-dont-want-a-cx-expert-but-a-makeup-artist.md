### A Perfectly Promising Meeting
I recently travelled to London to meet with a renowned global company that was looking for someone to help shape its Customer Experience programme.

The conversation got off to a brilliant start. My host talked me through the structure of their team, their working methods, and their current programme. I nodded along, already visualising how I could hit the ground running and ensure that I, and the whole team, would look like absolute rock stars from day one. She seemed to feel the same. The energy was high and there was a real sense of alignment. I was secretly thinking, 'I can really contribute here, and I'm going to love it.'

Then came the moment.


### The Number That Stopped My Pulse
And then she said it.

“Our NPS® is currently 75. The target for next year is 78.”

I'm pretty sure my brain short-circuited for a few seconds. I could feel myself going pale. She must have seen me trying to catch my breath, because she paused. I wasn’t sure whether this was a twisted test to see if I would call her out or just play along politely. My mouth opened and closed repeatedly. Eventually, the only thing that came to mind managed to escape my lips:
'... and what do you do with that?'


### The Question That Broke the Room
I decided to go for it. Blunt, but necessary.

"Imagine if we implemented a proper VoC programme that actually uncovered real areas for improvement. As a result, we would boost customer retention and grow revenue; the business would be healthier than ever. But – and it's a big 'but' – the NPS drops to 20. Would that still be considered a success?"

She took a couple of seconds.

Then: "No, that wouldn't be a success."

I think my jaw dropped at this point. Was this really happening?

They weren’t looking for a CX professional. They were looking for a make-up artist! Someone to make the score look pretty while the underlying issues remained hidden behind layers of foundation and contoured makeup.


### The Astronomical Reality Check
I gently pointed out that, by any objective standard, an NPS of 75 is astronomical. Companies around the world that are most dependent on customer feedback rarely go above 40.

Such a high score usually means one of two things: either your company's retention and revenue levels are skyrocketing beyond anything seen so far, or the programme itself is designed to manipulate the number rather than reflect reality and identify areas for improvement.

She shrugged. 'The target comes from the CEO. It is what it is.'

And that was that.


### The Train Ride Home: Pure Devastation
That sentence tells you more about governance maturity than any dashboard ever could.

If a number is set from above and cannot be questioned, the CX function's role is no longer to reflect reality.

Its role is to maintain alignment with expectation.

On the way back, I felt genuinely gutted. What had started as an exciting opportunity now felt like a project doomed to fail. I kept replaying the conversation, wondering how anyone could tie an entire CX programme to a vanity metric that was already off the charts.

The thing is, you don't implement a CX programme to chase a number. You implement it to understand why customers buy from you, why they come back (or don't), why some satisfied customers leave and why some dissatisfied customers remain loyal.

You implement it to find improvements that can actually be put into practice and that will have a positive impact on retention and revenue, not just on a pretty dashboard.

The minute you set an unrealistic target for one KPI — especially when it’s wildly out of line with retention, CSAT or actual repeat purchase behaviour — you should start asking serious questions. A true NPS of 75+ should mean that people are queuing around the block, camping overnight to buy from you and recommending you to everyone they meet before they've even had their first coffee.


### So… What Now?
Normally I'm the person who walks into rooms full of decision makers. I deliver the honest (sometimes brutally honest) truth. This is based on customer data, solicited or unsolicited. That's literally why organisations hire CX professionals. They want the unfiltered view so they can make better decisions.

But this one has me torn.

Should I just pass on this one?

Or should I accept, walk in on day one and try to start the revolution from the inside?

The big question is whether there will actually be space to question the establishment. In my experience, good CEOs and senior leaders base their critical decisions on raw, brutal truth. They also appreciate it when it comes unfiltered or undecorated. But is this company's leadership team ready to hear unfiltered facts that nobody else seems willing to tell them?

I still don’t have the answer. But writing this has helped me to process it. If you’ve ever found yourself in a similar situation, staring at a beautifully presented CX strategy built on sand, I’d love to hear how you handled it.
Because, ultimately, real CX isn't about painting over the cracks. It's about fixing the wall itself.
