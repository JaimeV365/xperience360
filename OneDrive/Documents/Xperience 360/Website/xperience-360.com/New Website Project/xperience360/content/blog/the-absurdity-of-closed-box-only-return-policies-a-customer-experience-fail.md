Can anyone tell me what's the point of a closed-box-only return policy? Because I can't figure it out.

I went to the shopping centre today, in search of a mouse. Nothing fancy, but I wanted to see one of those silent mice with a very quiet click that is less annoying to other people when I'm out and about on the train or in a cafe.

So I was in the mice and keyboards aisle of this large store, but there were only one or two models on display. The other twenty or so models were in their boxes.

So I read the specs and tried to make decisions, and eventually, I picked one of them and approached one of the staff. I explained that I was looking for one of those silent mice and just wanted to know if I could see one and see how it felt, how loud the click actually was, and how big or small it would feel in my hand.

A very absurd conversation followed:

- Unfortunately, we can't open the boxes so I can't really show you the models.

- I see. So there's no display unit for this model?

- No, I'm afraid not. But I can show you pictures from our website.

- From the website? But it's in my hand right now. Can we not open the box carefully and look at the product I'm ready to buy?

- I guess we should be able to do that, but I'm afraid we can't, sir. Sorry.

- So I can't see or touch what I'm buying?

- (Smiling nervously) I think it's a bit silly, but unfortunately, yes, that's how it is. Sorry.

- What if I buy it now and open the box myself? Can I return it if I don't like it?

- We have a 30-day guarantee on unopened boxes.

- (At this point we were both almost laughing at the absurdity of the situation)

- On unopened boxes you said? So I am supposed to make my choice based on how pretty the boxes look and how great the pictures on the website are. Is that it?

- (Smiling) Yes, I'm afraid it is, sir.

I didn't buy anything, obviously.

On my way back, I was just wondering how anyone could think of serving the customer by coming up with a return policy that only applies to closed boxes. What are we buying then, boxes? What real situation would this policy cover?

Imagine if instead of a rigid policy, the store simply had one display model for each type of mouse. I could have tested it, touched it, felt it, made as many clicks as I wanted and finally made my choice with confidence and walked out a happy customer with no worries about returns or refunds. Instead, they lost a sale and probably a customer. How many others walk away frustrated every day? A small change in policy could have made all the difference.

I, of course, bought the mouse elsewhere, a shop with a sensible return policy. I am free to open the box, test the mouse properly and, if I still don't like it, return it for a full refund. Just as you would expect.

That's how you retain customers and maintain a good reputation, simply by offering common sense policies, especially when it comes to the small print.
